;;; Trying to bundle breeze's source code in one big file
#|

Which makes me think: it would be nice to have some kind
to "transactions" when loading common lisp code. To avoid half-loaded
code.

EDIT before I commit: I didn't have much time and didn't get far. BUT,
I managed to figure out that (surprise surprise, the dependencies are
hard to handle correctly...).
