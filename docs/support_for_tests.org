#+title: Support for tests

* PROtocol and TESTcase manager                         :test:3rd_parties:

PROTEST is a tool for defining protocols and test cases written in and
for Common Lisp.
* trying to find discrepancies between the packages and test packages  :test:

or betweew test system and the system under test

I consider this task "DONE" because I did _try_ to find discrepancies
between the package ~breeze.refactor~ and ~breeze.test.refactor~. I
used the convention that each "command" defined in ~breeze.refator~
should have a test with the same name (i.e. the same symbol-name). I
have a test that fails if this "invariant" is not held.

In the future, I would like to

** TODO Figure out how to generalize "finding missing tests by discrepancies" :test:ux:config:

Not everyone is going to have the same conventions.

** TODO Improve the current test by looking for prefix instead

E.g package ~a~ has an exported symbol ~s~, it's corresponding test
package is ~a.test~.

The current implementation would try to find a test named ~s~ in
~a.test~ (for example ~a.test::s~, or ~"s"~ (test names can be string
in parachute), it would be nice to have it also considers tests that
have the _prefix_ ~s~.

Why? Because I have some automatically generated test (a bit like
snapshot tests), it's very convenient that they have the same name as
the thing they are testing. Using a prefix would let me have multiple
kind of tests for each (automatically generated or not).

Do I want to check if each "types" of tests are implemented?

Can parachute's `deftest`'s be easily augmented with some metadata?
That might help too.

* TODO Integrate with multiple test framework                          :test:

See @phoe's [[https://github.com/phoe/protest][phoe/protest]].

* TODO It's too easy to kill the test-runner                   :tech_debt:ux:
