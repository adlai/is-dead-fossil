#+title: Support for bug reports

* TODO Make it easy to report a bugs                                 :ux:ops:

- OS version
- lisp version
- editor version
- quicklisp
  - client version
  - distributions
- for each dependency
  - from which distribution the system come from
  - version of the system

* Generalized support for bug reports                                  :idea:

Maybe there could be a way to report bugs for any projects (not just
breeze)?
