#+title: Error recovery

- basic: use "synchronization points", places where it looks like a
good place to restart parsing after an invalid parse

- it would be much easier to pin-point the source of the failure if we
start from a previous good state (incremental parsing)

- I noticed that for lisp, a lot of things would be "easy" to parse
backward, this would help tremendously pin-pointing where a "bad
parse" begins.



An easy case for error recovery:

#+begin_src lisp
  #|
  it's missing a closing "pipehash" before the end of the string
#+end_src
