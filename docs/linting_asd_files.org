#+title: Linting asd files

* Use =(in-package #:asdf-user)= at the start of the file

Using (interned) symbols in the .asd files _might_ intern symbols in
=*package*= (especially if someone tries to =(read ...)= the =.asd=
file.

* Look for missing files

I could see one nice workflow:
1. Open the system defintion
2. Add a file in the =:components= list
3. The linter highlights the missing file
4. The user choose a "code action" that creates the file and opens it
   in the editor, perhaps even adding a package definition at the
   start.
