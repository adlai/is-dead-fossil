    What annoys you when developing in lisp?

I find that setting up a test framework is more difficult than it
should be, so any effort on this area is appreciated. I mean: starting
with 5am is ok (but could be easier with an editor command), running
it from the CLI/a CI is less OK, getting the correct return code of
the tests needs more work, etc.
