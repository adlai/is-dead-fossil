#+title: Improve CL docstring's at runtime

I noticed that, on sbcl, you can =(setf (documentation 'x 'function)
...= on symbols that are part of the =cl= package (which I didn't
expect because of the package lock). It _could_ be nice to load a
package during development that adds examples to the docstrings, and
perhaps even "links" between the defintions?
