* Roadmap

This roadmap serves as a rule of thumb for priorisation.

1. Improve the reader, add tests
2. Make commands more declarative (see [[file:src/pattern.lisp][pattern.lisp]])
3. Improve the documentation
4. Implement better refactor commands
5. Improve breeze-eval function, add tests
6. Reduce breeze's dependencies
7. Add support for other editors

** Status of the roadmap

As of 2023-11-24, all the points from 1 through 5 are being worked on
concurrently.
