* Roadmap

This roadmap serves as a rule of thumb for priorisation.

1. Make the reader and linting incremental
2. Make a CLI that can be used
   - in the CI to generate a "code quality
     report"
   - from an editor for linting and fixing
3. Make commands more declarative (see [[file:src/pattern.lisp][pattern.lisp]])
4. Improve the documentation
5. Implement better refactor commands
6. Improve breeze-eval function, add tests
7. Add support for other editors
   - this should help improving the internals
8. Reduce breeze's dependencies
   - break the "breeze" system in smaller systems, these could have
     more dependencies as needed
   - vendor alexandria
   - maybe vendor bordeaux-threads and/or chanl
   - this might not be necessary if breeze could be 100% out-of-image

** Status of the roadmap

As of 2023-11-24, all the points from 1 through 5 are being worked on
concurrently.
