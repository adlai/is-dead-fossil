* Random ideas

** A command to insert compiler notes (at point) as a comment

** (tips), (tips "test"), (tips "doc")
** (next) ;; what's next? print functions that aren't done, that have no tests or documentation.
*** functions that aren't implemented or done
*** functions that have no tests
*** functions that have no documentation
*** Have a plain user-controlled task list
** Evaluate quality of documentation
*** e.g. if the documentation is almost just the name of the function
*** Make sure it doesn't "only" refer to another function
*** It's more that the content of the function

(defun print-x (x)
  "print (* x x)"
  (print (* x x))

*** Make sure that all package have a :documentation
*** Make sure that all classes have a :documentation
** Evaluation the quality of the code
*** Cyclomatic complexity
*** Length of variable names
*** linting in general
** Compare the files in a system's directory and the actual components.
** See BIST to probalistically compare functions
*** Use a PRNG to generate inputs, use a hash to fingerprint the outputs
See [[file:scratch-files/function-fingerprinting.lisp][function-fingerprinting.lisp]]

** Generate test for existing functions

- The more we know the types of the expression, the more we can narrow
  down the search.
- It would be easier if we knew which expression are safe to execute

** Generate code based on desired input/output

- The more we know the types of the expression, the more we can narrow
  down the search.
- It would be easier if we knew which expression are safe to execute
- The linter can help choose better results
- Using e-graph to refactor candidates can help suggest helper
  functions


*** See Programming by examples (inductive synthesis)

** A lot of things could be done by instrumenting the code

Which is one of the reason behind wrapping the definitions (e.g. =breeze:defun=)

- fault injection
- program (dynamic) slicing
- Stepping though code
- profiling
- test coverage
- coverage guided
- profile-guided optimization

** Program slicing

*** For code navigation

It would be nice to be able to search for something (e.g. calls to
make-instance) only in a certain slice (e.g. from the "call tree" of
foo).

*** Correlate with unit tests

If we have multiple tests on the same piece of code, we can use the
slices from the tests that pass and the tests that fail to narrow down
which slice is probably the source of the failure.

** Use equivalence-graph e-graph to suggest refactors

Main resource: [[https://egraphs-good.github.io/][E-Graphs Good]]

This might be hard and complicated, I was thinking that I should start
by making this work on a very small scope. For example, if the user
ask to suggest some refactors, we can look for forms that contains
only arithmetic (again, just an example) and nothing else, that use
equality saturation to find interesting equivalent forms and propose
them to the user.

*** Small discussion I had on lobste.rs about e-graphs on lisp

- [[https://lobste.rs/s/myyznl/tooling_for_tooling#c_apjopu][Comment on Lobste.rs]]

The important bit:

#+begin_quote
egg is great for algebraic rewrites, but doesn’t have good builtin
tools for associative/commutative operations, nor for
alpha-equivalence and rewriting under binders. I deliberately left
names out of my syntax so that rewriting would be easier; this won’t
be as simple for Lisps in general.
#+end_quote

*** I already started working on implementing equivalence graphs

A while ago I started by writing a disjoint sets data structure (also
known as union-find, based on the 2 mains operations it supports).
