** lisp listener
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       93da5b9d-9593-45b1-9f71-f49d01c3e95d
:END:

- More often called "lisp repl".
- I use this term to try to avoid confusion with an hypothetical
  future actual REPL.
- You could describe that as a "client-server REPL".

** REPl
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       824a7d5d-d11f-40b0-ae0e-b83ea7dbf812
:END:

- Stands for "Read-Eval-Print-Loop"
- Most people think about "command line" when they hear REPL, but in
  the case of lisp, it usually means a "listener".

** e-graph

"e-graph" stands for "equivalence graph", it is a data structure.

See [[id:32155195-1bc4-4f2d-8f6a-12fb0bd68ecc][E-graphs]].


** TODO Package-local nicknames (PLN)
