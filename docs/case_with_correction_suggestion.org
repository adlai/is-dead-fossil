#+title: Case with correction suggestion

Image a variant of =cl:ecase= that find the nearest match and provides
a corresponding restart for it.

#+begin_src lisp
(let ((x 'boo))
  (case x
    (foo ...)
    (bar ...)))
;; => error: 'boo is not one of '(foo bar)
;; => restart: use 'foo instead
#+end_src

What if there are many options with the same edit distance?
