Iterator on vectors and nested vectors that:
- takes care of "recursing" into some values
- conditionally skips some values

Because both the syntax trees and the (compiled) patterns are nested
vectors.

Historical note: this started as a struct in pattern.lisp. This is a
generalization of that first iteration (ha!).

;;; Notes on skipping values while iterating

#|

I'm not sure which way to specify which values to skip...

1. put a predicate in a special variable
2. put a predicate in the iterator
3. use a specialized method

A) 1. is what I was already using in the first version of the
iterators (in pattern.lisp, using defstruct)

B) 1. and 2. are pretty flexible

C) 1. means that you cannot easily have different iterators that skip
different things at the same time (you would have to bind the special
variable to a different function before every call that uses the
predicate).

D) 3. means that you need to create a new class for each things you might
want to skip. this might be harder to compose that 1. or 2.

Conclusion:

I think I'll go with "2. put a predicate in the iterator" because of
C) and D)

P.S. By the same logic, I'll put a predicate in the iterator to
control whether to recursively iterate over a value's elements.
